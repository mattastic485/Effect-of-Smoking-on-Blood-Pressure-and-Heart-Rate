# Effect of Smoking on Blood Pressure and Heart Rate
This project is an experimental research on the effect of smoking on blood pressure and heart rate I conducted for an Experimental Psychology course I attended during my time at the City College of New York.
This analysis is from a subset of the Framingham Heart Study dataset using R on [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).
* The .Rmd file documents the various functions I performed to the dataset, such as wrangling, testing, and visualizing.
* The .docx is a written report of my findings that incorporates the calculations and visualizations from the .Rmd file.
